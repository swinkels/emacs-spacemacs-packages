;;; Commentary:

;; Ghostel is an Emacs terminal emulator powered by libghostty-vt, the
;; terminal emulation library extracted from the Ghostty project.  A
;; native Zig dynamic module handles VT parsing, terminal state, rendering,
;; and (for local buffers) PTY I/O, while this Elisp layer manages keymaps,
;; buffers, user-facing commands, and remote process integration.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   M-x ghostel               Open a new terminal
;;   M-x ghostel-project       Open a terminal in the current project root
;;   M-x ghostel-other         Switch to next terminal or create one
;;   M-x ghostel-next / ghostel-previous
;;                             Cycle through all ghostel buffers
;;   M-x ghostel-list-buffers  Pick a ghostel buffer to switch to
;;   M-x ghostel-project-next / ghostel-project-previous /
;;       ghostel-project-list-buffers
;;                             Same, scoped to the current project
;;
;; Key bindings in the terminal buffer:
;;
;;   Most keys are sent directly to the shell.  Keys in
;;   `ghostel-keymap-exceptions' (C-c, C-x, M-x, etc.) pass through
;;   to Emacs.  Terminal control and navigation use a C-c prefix:
;;
;;   C-c C-c   Interrupt          C-c C-z   Suspend
;;   C-c C-d   EOF                C-c C-\   Quit
;;   C-c C-t   Copy mode          C-c C-y   Paste
;;   C-c M-l   Clear scrollback   C-q       Send next key literally
;;   C-c M-w   Copy scrollback    C-y / M-y Yank / yank-pop
;;   C-c C-n / C-c C-p            Next/previous hyperlink
;;   C-c M-n / C-c M-p            Next/previous prompt (OSC 133)
;;
;; Copy mode (C-c C-t) freezes the display and enables standard Emacs
;; navigation.  Set mark with C-SPC, select text, then M-w to copy.
;;
;; Shell integration:
;;
;;   Directory tracking (OSC 7), prompt navigation (OSC 133), and the
;;   `ghostel_cmd' helper are auto-injected for bash, zsh, and fish —
;;   no shell rc changes needed.  Controlled by `ghostel-shell-integration'
;;   (default t); set it to nil to source etc/shell/ghostel.{bash,zsh,fish}
;;   manually instead.
;;
;; Native module:
;;
;;   A pre-built binary is downloaded automatically on first use.
;;   To build from source instead (requires exactly Zig 0.16.0), run
;;   zig build --prefix . from the project root, or M-x ghostel-module-compile.
;;   M-x ghostel-download-module re-fetches the pre-built binary.
;;
;; See also: evil-ghostel.el (evil-mode integration), ghostel-compile.el
;; (TTY-backed M-x compile replacement), ghostel-eshell.el (eshell
;; visual-command integration).  TRAMP paths as `default-directory'
;; spawn remote shells; see README.md for details.

Either a string (just the executable path) or a list whose first

arguments passed to that executable.  For example:

  (setq ghostel-shell \\='(\"/bin/zsh\" \"--login\"))

For bash, list long options (e.g. `--rcfile') before single-character
ones (e.g. `-i'); bash rejects long options that follow short ones.

On macOS, ghostel additionally wraps the shell via `login(1)' by
default so the shell starts as a login shell (matching Apple's
Terminal.app and Ghostty), which sources `~/.zprofile' /
`~/.bash_profile' as users expect.  See `ghostel-macos-login-shell'."

The default \"xterm-ghostty\" advertises ghostel's capability set via
the bundled terminfo entry: synchronized output (DEC 2026), Kitty
keyboard protocol, true color, colored underlines, focus reporting,
and more.  Apps that key off these capabilities — Claude Code, modern
TUIs, neovim, tmux — will use their fast paths.  Notably,
synchronized output eliminates choppy partial-redraw effects when
Claude Code or similar TUIs repaint over a large scrollback.

OSC 52 clipboard is supported (`ghostel-enable-osc52', off by
default) but intentionally NOT advertised in the bundled terminfo,
to avoid silent yank drops when the option is disabled.

Set to \"xterm-256color\" to fall back to a generic terminal.  When
`ghostel-term' is not \"xterm-ghostty\", the bundled terminfo and
`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty' are not advertised, so nothing claims to be
Ghostty.  This is also the right setting if outbound `ssh' from a
ghostel buffer trips up on remote hosts that lack the xterm-ghostty
terminfo entry."

(defcustom ghostel-environment nil
  "Extra environment variables for ghostel shell processes.

A list of \"KEY=VALUE\" strings, prepended to `process-environment'
before spawning the shell.  A bare \"KEY\" (no `=') unsets the variable.

For local spawns, entries here take precedence over ghostel's own
variables (TERM, INSIDE_EMACS, PWD, EMACS_GHOSTEL_PATH,
shell-integration vars), so a user who sets TERM here wins — which
will also disable ghostel's shell integration if the chosen TERM
breaks its assumptions.

Also honored via `dir-locals.el' for per-project overrides.

TRAMP caveats:
- Entries with `=' are propagated to the remote shell.
- TERM/TERMINFO/TERM_PROGRAM/TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION/COLORTERM here
  are ignored for remote spawns and overridden unconditionally by
  the per-spawn `/bin/sh -c' wrapper after `infocmp'-probing the
  remote for `xterm-ghostty' terminfo.  TRAMP's
  `tramp-local-environment-variable-p' filter strips env entries
  that match the local default top-level `process-environment',
  so pushing TERM via env was unreliable; the wrapper exports
  these from inside the remote shell instead, where the filter
  doesn't reach.  Customize `ghostel-term' (locally, or per-host
  via dir-locals or `connection-local-set-profile-variables') to
  change what gets advertised; on a customized branch the wrapper
  exports `TERM=$ghostel-term' only — no `TERM_PROGRAM*' ghostty
  advertisement.  Every other entry in this list still propagates.
- INSIDE_EMACS is rewritten by TRAMP via `tramp-inside-emacs',
  which appends `,tramp:VER' to whatever value is in scope.  For
  ghostel that means the remote shell sees `ghostel,tramp:VER'
  rather than the bare `ghostel' set locally — the leading
  `ghostel' segment is preserved.
- Bare \"KEY\" unset works for TRAMP-sh methods (`ssh', `sudo', ...)
  which emit `unset KEY' in the remote wrapper, but is dropped by
  the generic handler used by `adb' and `sshfs'.

Example: \\='(\"LANG=en_US.UTF-8\" \"CC=clang\")"

The full scrollback is materialized into the Emacs buffer so that
`isearch', `consult-line', and other buffer-based commands work
across history.  Each materialized row also lives in the Emacs
buffer with text properties for color/style/links, so the
practical Emacs heap cost is roughly equal to the libghostty
allocation, and large values noticeably slow down sustained
high-throughput output (e.g. `cat huge.log')."

(defcustom ghostel-cell-pixel-scale 'auto
  "Physical-to-logical pixel ratio for cell-size reporting.

Used when answering XTWINOPS queries (CSI 14/16 t) and when telling
libghostty's kitty graphics protocol the cell dimensions.  Image
tools — timg, yazi, tmux passthrough — query the terminal for cell
pixel size to compute placement dimensions; if the value reported is
smaller than what the standalone Ghostty terminal would report, they
either fall back to half-block rendering (timg) or fill more cells
than expected with upscaled, blocky output (yazi).

`auto' computes the display DPI from `display-mm-width' and
`display-pixel-width' and uses DPI/96 directly as a float.  Standard
~96 DPI displays resolve to ~1.0; HiDPI displays (~150 DPI) resolve
to ~1.5; ~192 DPI displays to ~2.0.  If the display's physical size
isn't reported (some multi-monitor setups, virtual displays), falls
back to 1.

This is a heuristic — Emacs has no portable API for the OS-level
backing scale factor, so exact parity with standalone Ghostty
\(which measures cell size in real physical pixels via the window
server) requires setting an explicit number here.  Useful overrides:
the exact `physical_cell_w / default-font-width' ratio (e.g. 2.28) for
pixel-perfect parity with standalone Ghostty's image rendering, or
1 to opt out of HiDPI-aware reporting altogether.

Note that `image-scaling-factor' is *not* a useful signal here:
Emacs's `auto' resolves it from `frame-char-width' (a font-width
heuristic for image-vs-text scaling), not from the display's DPI

The default recognizes:
- Standard shell prompts: `$ ', `# ', `% ', `> '
- Python and similar REPLs: `>>> '
- Themed prompts: `λ ', `❯ ' (Starship/Pure/Powerlevel10k),
  `➜ ' (oh-my-zsh robbyrussell), `→ '
- Prompts padded with a no-break space (U+00A0) instead of a
  plain space, e.g. Claude Code's `> '

The negated character class `[^#$%>λ❯→➜\\n]\\{0,60\\}' forces the match to
stop at the *first* prompt character on the line, so command lines echoed into
scrollback (e.g. `$ echo $foo') are detected by their leading prompt prefix
rather than a `$' deeper in the line.  The `\\{0,60\\}' bound caps that prefix
at 60 columns: a prompt character only counts near the start of a line, so
a stray `%'/`#' deep in command output (e.g. the `%' in a `100%' progress line)
is treated as output, not a prompt.

Trade-off: any line that *starts* with one of these characters is
treated as a prompt line.  Diff output (`> excluded'), markdown
headings (`# Heading'), and lines like `5 > 3' will yield false
positives for column-aware motions.  OSC 133 integration is the
robust fix - see the README's shell-integration section.

Customize this variable to add or replace prompt characters for
prompts the default doesn't catch (e.g., `▶ ', `» ', `🦀 ').  Set
to nil to disable the regex fallback entirely (OSC 133 only)."

2. Probes via `infocmp xterm-ghostty'.  The probe honors all of
   ncurses' standard lookup paths (the prepended dir, $TERMINFO,
   ~/.terminfo, $TERMINFO_DIRS, and the compiled defaults), so
   it succeeds whenever the entry is reachable any way — bundled,
   system-installed, or pushed via `ghostel-tramp-shell-integration'.
   On success, advertise ghostty; on failure, fall back to

verbatim.  `COLORTERM=truecolor' is exported unconditionally."

(defun ghostel--init-buffer (buffer &optional rows cols)
  "Initialize BUFFER as a ghostel terminal.
This is the invariant boundary between an Emacs buffer and its native
terminal handle: BUFFER is made empty, renderer-coupled buffer-local
state is reset, and the newly created terminal is attached immediately
as BUFFER's buffer-local `ghostel--term'.  It intentionally does not
reset unrelated buffer-local state such as manual rename/identity bookkeeping.

Optional ROWS and COLS override size detection.  Otherwise terminal
dimensions come from BUFFER's displayed window when one exists,
otherwise from the selected window.  Height uses `window-screen-lines',
the metric the standard `adjust-window-size-function' path also uses,
not `window-body-height'.  The former divides the window's pixel height
by the buffer's `default-line-height', which respects
`face-remapping-alist' and `:height' on the default face; the latter
divides by frame char height.  When a theme remaps default —
`nano-light' / `nano-dark' do this — the two metrics disagree, and
using `window-body-height' would size the terminal to N rows only to
have the standard adjust-fn immediately resize to N-K, sending a
startup SIGWINCH that some TUI apps (Claude Code's /tui fullscreen)
handle imperfectly (issue #192).

This function does not start a process; callers decide what program to
spawn after initialization."
